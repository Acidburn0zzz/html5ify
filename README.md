## html5ify

A Chrome extension that aims to give you the best HTML5 experience possible. It
particularly aims to remove the use of Flash media on websites when there is 
a better HTML5 version available.

Implemented so far:

* Amazon.{de|com|co.uk} song previews are played in an HTML5 ```<audio>``` tag
* You're automatically joining the [Youtube HTML5 beta](http://youtube.com/html5)
* You use the Vimeo HTML5 player
